- I've wrote a .gitignore for my own directory. I'm guessing we'll create a separate one for each of us seeing that our directory structure may be slightly different
- I'm planning to write a bash script to automate the building process. Tell me if you want it.
- Btw did you know you can colour code your git output to make it easier to see? The command's git config --global color.ui auto
- For now I'm splitting each of the options into their seperate file, that way it's easier for us to split up and code without worrying that we'll accidentally merger the wrong stuff.
- For now our program would look a bit like this:

  mysync.h  ->  template.c (maybe renamed)  ->  mysync.c
	 |                                              ^
	 |_>  all option_*.c  --------------------------|

- Also I haven't exactly have it all figure out yet but we must ensure that our functions can work together.
- I'll write up the specifications for each of the options later on.

- Renaming
  mysync.h  ->  mysync.c ->  mysync_main.c
	 |                             ^
	 |_>  all option_*.c  ---------|
- As we're linking to libproj2.a, our main functions will be hidden until we implement them.
- Changed my mind in the end, the template.c file got split up.
- Please utilise libproj2.a to test and debug.
- I've mainly isolated the tasks into 2 parts, syncing and non-syncing. You'll be doing the syncing and I'll do the rest. The options are relevant to the tasks (ie. options a, r, and u are relevant to syncing). Therefore it's up to you to design them.
